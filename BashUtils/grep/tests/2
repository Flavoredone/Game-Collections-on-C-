My daddy doesn't like to heat it. He takes this soup, pours it into a frying pan and starts frying. 


       He adds a huge amount of onions, garlic, black and red pepper, and tomato paste on top. It's all fried until it smokes. Then it's taken off the fire and cooled on the balcony. Then daddy brings it in and sprinkles it with mayonnaise and starts to eat it. He eats it from the frying pan with a spoon. He eats and says in a half-whisper, "Ooh, wow. He has sweat on his forehead. He kindly offers me one sometimes, but I refuse. Do I have to tell you what a wild fart he makes afterwards? It stinks so bad it makes the wallpaper peel off the walls.
