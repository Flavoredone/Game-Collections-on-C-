NAME
     grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep, bzgrep, bzegrep, bzfgrep, zgrep, zegrep, zfgrep â€“ file pattern searcher

SYNOPSIS
     grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlMmnOopqRSsUVvwXxZz] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file] [--binary-files=value] [--color[=when]] [--colour[=when]]
          [--context[=num]] [--label] [--line-buffered] [--null] [pattern] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular
     expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line without its trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.  Each input line that matches at
     least one of the patterns is written to the standard output.

     grep is used for simple patterns and basic regular expressions (BREs); egrep can handle extended regular expressions (EREs).  See re_format(7) for more
     information on regular expressions.  fgrep is quicker than both grep and egrep, but can only handle fixed patterns (i.e., it does not interpret regular
     expressions).  Patterns may consist of one or more lines, allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.
